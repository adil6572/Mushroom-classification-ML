## Introduction

Welcome to the Mushroom Classification using ML project! The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify mushrooms as edible or poisonous based on various features.

## Objective

Mushroom poisoning can have serious consequences, and accurate classification is crucial for mushroom enthusiasts and mushroom hunters. The objective of this project is to build a robust classification model that can help identify potentially harmful mushrooms, promoting safe mushroom consumption.

## Data

The dataset used for this project contains information about mushrooms, including features such as cap shape, cap color, odor, gill size, etc. Each mushroom is labeled as edible or poisonous. The dataset is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/mushroom-classification).



## Machine Learning Algorithms

We have employed the following machine learning algorithms for mushroom classification:

1. Decision Trees
2. Random Forest 
3. Support Vector Machines (SVM)
4.  Logistic Regression

## Results

The performance of our best-performing model is as follows:

- Accuracy: 100%
- Precision: 100%
- Recall: 100%
- F1 Score: 100%
